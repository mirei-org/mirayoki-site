            <p id="wondering">you may be wondering what a QR code does around curry‚Äôs
                bathrooms/classrooms.</p>
            <p id="showYou">i would like to
                show you something</p>

            <p>hey there!</p>
            <p>just like you, I am a curry student. maybe you have seen me. maybe
                we have talked or even eaten lunch together.</p>
            <p>today, I really put on a lot of effort
                to share this with you.</p>
            <p>since COVID began I started a software project on my free time that
                I have put on a lot of work and I think its time for it to see daylight.</p>
            <p>this project is a discord bot called Mirayoki. it uses the latest techonologies to deliver epic
                experiences
                in a ridiculous short time.
            </p>
            <p>it also lets you manage your discord server
                directly from the message box (no more confusing websites!) and uses brand-new
                Slash (/) commands (pretty cool, huh?) for the absolutely affordable
                price of 0 dollars</p>
            <p>after a few years of developing it, i think it is time for the world to see what a small yet powerful bot
                can do.</p>
            <p>and I really wanted to share it with my school community first since I know most of us use discord on a
                daily basis :)</p>
            <p>if you want, and feel like it, add Mirayoki to your discord server and
                try it out.</p>
            <a id="theLink"><img src="media/addMira.png"></a>
            <p>i really hope you like it and enjoy it &lt;3</p>
            <p id="moreQuestions">if you have more questionsss ‚òü</p>
            <div id="questions">
                <a onclick="whyShouldI()" class="question">i'm not sure, why should I use this?</a>
                <hr class="questionLine">
                <div id="whyShouldI" class="answer">
                    <p>mirayoki can replace the trio (or group) of bots you have to ban, mute,
                        have fun and be goofy (ok maybe not the music one yet).</p>

                    <p>It is an all-in-one solution. you will be the first to use a next
                        generation bot that uses cluster AI and you will be helping
                        your fellow local classmate to develop more amazing things.</p>
                    <h3>cluster AI?</h3>
                    <p>it is the engine that lets mirayoki be insanely fast. it can make choices by approximating the
                        time a
                        task would take to be done, and relays queries to other servers in case it is busy.</p>
                    <p>if i'm not wrong, this is the first use of such AI in a Discord Bot</p>

                    <p>plus, discord checks periodically for security issues in bots (and Mira
                        has been online for some years now).</p>
